While the natural finish shows off the stunning grain of the top, the natural properties of the tonewood deliver a bright, tight sound, which only gets richer and sweeter the more it’s played.',
            
            'The fingerboard is roasted maple – this tonewood is naturally warm sounding and the roasting process removes impurities to create an incredibly stable and resonant addition to your sound. The roasted maple also makes the fingerboard more consistent across its length, ensuring each note will ring out with equal clarity.',

They have a clear pick attack and balanced response across all the frequencies, making them ideal for a wide range of genres. The HSS configuration gives the TQM1 a balance between powerful bridge-position tones and nuanced single coil sounds.',

The bone nut and Gotoh locking tuners give a stable platform and low-friction action for tuning stability. Despite the non-locking tremolo design, the Gotoh tremolo bridge provides a smooth 2-pivot action that still offers extreme whammy bar use. The locking tuners will ensure your strings remain locked in place, and they feature height adjustable pegs to setup the ideal string relief.',
